Welcome to Majin Tester! 

I'm glad you decided to train your psychic abilities with the 1.0 version of Majin Tester.

Turn your monitor away from you, or make sure you are not facing your monitor, and remote view the image that appears on the screen when the program starts. 

If you hit the space bar a new image will appear. There are 50 images overall. 

If you don't know how to conduct remote viewing sessions, please educate yourself with this video: https://youtu.be/s-QbfuXt5us?si=DLCvzQbm3_43Nr8a

I encourage you to push the boundaries of your remote viewing abilities and aim to consistently perceive all 50 images correctly. In fact, I challenge you to eventually remote view all 50 images correctly without the remote viewing template described in the video. Direct Fluent Perception. Don't fool yourself into thinking you got it right when you only got it kind of right and correctly identified some colors here or there. Pursue perfection. Make your remote viewing abilities as accurate as your visual sight. A clear mind can perceive across time and space with a high enough resolution that would put an 8K television to shame. Don't doubt your abilities, refine them. 

Pursue Psychic Abilities!
Passivity is Death.
